DBeaver is a SQL client software application and universal database management tool for EDB Postgres Advanced and EDB Postgres Extended servers. With DBeaver you can manipulate your data like you would in a regular spreadsheet. You have the ability to view, create, modify, save, and delete all Postgres data types. The features resemble those of a regular spreadsheet, as you can create analytical reports based on records from different data storages and export information in an appropriate format. DBeaver also provides you with a powerful editor for SQL, data and schema migration, monitoring of database connection sessions, and plenty of administration features.
