You can use the zypper package manager to install a Migration toolkit on an SLES 12 host. `zypper` attempts to satisfy package dependencies as it installs a package, but requires access to specific repositories that are not hosted at EnterpriseDB.

1.  You must assume superuser privileges and stop any firewalls before installing Migration Toolkit. Then, use the following commands to add EnterpriseDB repositories to your system:

    ```text
    zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/
    edb-sles.repo
    ```

2.  The command creates the repository configuration files in the /etc/zypp/repos.d directory. Use the following command to refresh the metadata on your SLES host to include the EnterpriseDB repository:

    ```text
    zypper refresh
    ```

    When prompted, provide credentials for the repository; specify `a` to always trust the provided key and update the metadata to include the EnterpriseDB repository.

3.  You must also add SUSEConnect and the SUSE Package Hub extension to the SLES host, and register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories. Use the commands:

    ```text
    SUSEConnect -r 'REGISTRATION_CODE' -e 'EMAIL'

    SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12.5/x86_64

    SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12.5/x86_64
    ```

4.  Install SUSEConnect to register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories:

    ```text
    zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/
    Apache:/Modules/SLE_12_SP4/Apache:Modules.repo
    ```

5.  Use the following command to refresh the metadata:

    ```text
    zypper refresh
    ```

6.  Install OpenJDK (version 1.8) for Java based components:

    ```text
    zypper -n install java-1_8_0-openjdk
    ```

7.  Now you can use the zypper utility to install a Migration Toolkit:

    ```text
    zypper -n install edb-migrationtoolkit
    ```
