title: Upgrading an RPM installation
---

If you have an existing RPM installation, you can use `yum` to upgrade your repository configuration file and update to a more recent product version. To update the edb.repo file, assume superuser privileges and enter:

```text
yum upgrade edb-repo
```

yum will update the edb.repo file to enable access to the current EnterpriseDB repository, configured to connect with the credentials specified in your edb.repo file. Then, you can use yum to upgrade Migration toolkit:

```text
yum upgrade edb-migrationtoolkit
```
