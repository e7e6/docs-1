There are three steps to completing an installation:

- Setting up the repository
- Installing the package
- Initial configuration

For each step, you must be logged in as superuser.

To log in as a superuser:

```shell
sudo su -
```

## Setting up the repository

1. To register with EDB to receive credentials for the EDB repository, visit: [Repository Access Request](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

1. Set up the EDB repository:

   ```shell
   dnf -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
   ```

   This creates the /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo configuration file.

1. Add your EDB credentials to the edb.repo file:  

   ```shell
   sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
   ```

   Where `USERNAME:PASSWORD` is the username and password available from your
   [EDB account](https://www.enterprisedb.com/user).

1. Install the EPEL repository and refresh the cache:

   ```shell
   dnf -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
   dnf makecache
   ```

1. Enable the codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-\*-rpms repository since EPEL packages may depend on packages from it:

   ```shell
   ARCH=$( /bin/arch )
   subscription-manager repos --enable "codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-${ARCH}-rpms"
   ```

1. Disable the built-in PostgreSQL module:
   ```shell
   dnf -qy module disable postgresql
   ```

## Installing the package

```shell
dnf -y install edb-efm<xx>
```
where `<xx>` is the version number of Failover Manager.

## Initial configuration

If you are using Failover Manager to monitor a cluster owned by a user other than enterprisedb or postgres, see [Extending Failover Manager permissions](../../04_configuring_efm/04_extending_efm_permissions/#extending_efm_permissions).

After installing on each node of the cluster:

1.  Modify the [cluster properties file](../../04_configuring_efm/01_cluster_properties/#cluster_properties) on each node.
2.  Modify the [cluster members file](../../04_configuring_efm/03_cluster_members/#cluster_members) on each node.
3.  If applicable, configure and test virtual IP address settings and any scripts that are identified in the cluster properties file.
4.  Start the agent on each node of the cluster. For more information, see [Controlling the Failover Manager service](../../08_controlling_efm_service/#controlling-the-failover-manager-service).
