To install Failover Manager, you must have credentials that allow access to the EnterpriseDB repository. To request credentials for the repository, see the [EnterpriseDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/user/login).

Use the EnterpriseDB APT repository to install Failover Manager.

## Installing

1.  Assume superuser privileges:
    ```text
    sudo su â€“ 
    ```
2.  Configure the EnterpriseDB repository by substituting your EnterpriseDB credentials for the username and password placeholders in the following commands:

    ```text
    sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.enterprisedb.com/$(lsb_release -cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'

    sh -c 'echo "machine apt.enterprisedb.com login <username> password <password>" > /etc/apt/auth.conf.d/edb.conf'
    ```

3.  Add support to your system for secure APT repositories:
    ```text
    apt-get install apt-transport-https
    ```
4.  Add the EDB signing key:
    ```text
    wget -q -O - https://<username>:<password>@apt.enterprisedb.com/edb-deb.gpg.key | apt-key add -
    ```
5.  Update the repository meta data:
    ```text
    apt-get update
    ```
6.  Install Failover Manager:
    ```text
    apt-get -y install edb-efm42
    ```
## Initial configuration

If you are using Failover Manager to monitor a cluster owned by a user other than enterprisedb or postgres, see [Extending Failover Manager permissions](../../04_configuring_efm/04_extending_efm_permissions/#extending_efm_permissions).

After installing on each node of the cluster:

1.  Modify the [cluster properties file](../../04_configuring_efm/01_cluster_properties/#cluster_properties) on each node.
2.  Modify the [cluster members file](../../04_configuring_efm/03_cluster_members/#cluster_members) on each node.
3.  If applicable, configure and test virtual IP address settings and any scripts that are identified in the cluster properties file.
4.  Start the agent on each node of the cluster. For more information, see [Controlling the Failover Manager service](../../08_controlling_efm_service/#controlling-the-failover-manager-service).
